Sarah: Good morning everyone, thanks for making time for this. Let's get started with our Q4 planning session. As you know, we're at a critical juncture where we need to finalize our product roadmap for the next quarter, allocate resources effectively, and ensure we're aligned on priorities. Jessica, can you start by sharing the user research insights you've gathered?

Jessica: Thanks Sarah. So we conducted extensive user interviews over the past month - talked to about 45 users across different segments. The overwhelming feedback we're getting is around three main pain points. First, the onboarding experience is still too complex - new users are getting lost in the initial setup. Second, the mobile app performance has been a consistent complaint, especially around page load times. Third, and this is interesting, users want better personalization - they feel the product is too generic and doesn't adapt to their individual workflows.
