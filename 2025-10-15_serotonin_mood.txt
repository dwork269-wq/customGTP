Meeting Notes: Serotonin and Mood Regulation
Date: October 15, 2025

Overview:
- Serotonin is a neurotransmitter that contributes to feelings of well-being and happiness
- It's often associated with mood regulation, social behavior, and emotional balance
- Unlike dopamine (which is about motivation and drive), serotonin is more about contentment and satisfaction

Key Differences from Dopamine:
- Dopamine: "I want it" - drives pursuit and motivation
- Serotonin: "I have it" - creates feelings of satisfaction and well-being
- Both work together to create a balanced emotional state

Sources and Production:
- About 90% of serotonin is produced in the gut
- Sunlight exposure helps boost serotonin production
- Foods rich in tryptophan (precursor to serotonin): turkey, eggs, cheese, salmon, nuts

Impact on Behavior:
- Low serotonin levels linked to depression and anxiety
- Affects sleep quality (serotonin converts to melatonin)
- Influences appetite and digestion
- Plays a role in social dominance and status

Practical Takeaways:
- Regular sunlight exposure is important for mood
- Gut health directly impacts mental health
- Balance between dopamine-driven activities and serotonin-promoting activities is key
- Meditation and gratitude practices can boost serotonin levels
