# Sample Knowledge Base Repository

This folder demonstrates what your GitHub repository will look like after setting up the GPT-driven knowledge pipeline.

## 📁 Sample Files

This repository includes three example files to demonstrate the system:

1. **2025-10-14_dopamine_motivation.txt** - Notes about dopamine and motivation
2. **2025-10-15_serotonin_mood.txt** - Notes about serotonin and mood regulation
3. **2025-10-16_productivity_systems.txt** - Notes about productivity and habit formation

## 🎯 Purpose

These files show:

- How files are automatically named (date + keywords)
- The type of content you can store (meeting notes, research, transcriptions)
- How information is structured for easy retrieval
- Examples of different content types and formats

## 🔄 Your Actual Repository

When you set up your own GitHub repository:

1. **Start empty** or copy these examples
2. Files will be **automatically created** when you use the GPT
3. **Naming convention**: `YYYY-MM-DD_keywords.txt`
4. **Organization**: Keep in root or create subfolders by topic

## 📝 File Naming Examples

Your GPT will generate names like:

- `2025-10-19_team_meeting_q4.txt`
- `2025-10-20_research_ai_agents.txt`
- `2025-10-21_standup_sprint_review.txt`

## 🗂️ Optional Organization

You can organize with folders:

```
knowledge-base/
├── meetings/
│   └── 2025-10-19_team_q4.txt
├── research/
│   └── 2025-10-20_ai_agents.txt
└── notes/
    └── 2025-10-21_productivity.txt
```

Tell your GPT where to save files, and it will handle the rest!

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. Create your own GitHub repository
2. Follow the [SETUP_GUIDE.md](../SETUP_GUIDE.md)
3. Start saving your own content!

_These are example files only. Your actual knowledge base will be created automatically by your Custom GPT._
