Meeting Notes: Dopamine and Motivation
Date: October 14, 2025

Key Points:
- Dopamine is a neurotransmitter that plays a crucial role in motivation and reward-seeking behavior
- It's often called the "motivation molecule" because it drives us to take action toward goals
- Dopamine is released in anticipation of rewards, not just when receiving them
- This anticipatory release is what creates the drive to pursue goals

Research Findings:
- Studies show that dopamine levels spike when we expect a reward
- The dopamine system can be influenced by various factors including sleep, exercise, and diet
- Chronic stress can deplete dopamine levels, leading to decreased motivation

Practical Applications:
- Understanding dopamine can help in designing better habit formation strategies
- Breaking large goals into smaller milestones can provide more frequent dopamine hits
- Celebrating small wins is important for maintaining motivation

Next Steps:
- Research the relationship between dopamine and procrastination
- Explore how dopamine interacts with other neurotransmitters like serotonin
